<b>Problem statement</b>

Hosting and facilitating a research conference requires a lot of paperwork and management. The coordination on reviewing papers requires precise organization. Due to papers having specific requirements on being reviewed, they will pass through multiple hands and has potential risk of being under-reviewed without constant up to date supervision of the process. To handle these problems, it would be a good idea to provide a system to manage these things.  This system will need to provide interface for researchers to submit papers and register for conferences. It will have to allow reviewers to search and review these papers. The system will also have to provide an interface for the conference administrators to create and manage conferences, papers, and reviews.  

<b>Proposal</b>

We propose a software system to allow a research conference to be managed more efficiently. Registration will occur through the system, as well as the submission and reviewing of papers. The software will handle the restrictions and help reviewers make sure all papers are evenly reviewed.  The system will also make advertising conferences more organized and available to the community.
